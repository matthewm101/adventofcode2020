# adventofcode2020

My programs for completing the 2020 Advent of Code. 

All programs were written in Rust. Every program can be executed by running `cargo run` or `cargo run --release`. Every program reads input.txt as its input.

Each program should compile successfully on a stable release of Rust, and only standard library functions are used (no other dependencies).
